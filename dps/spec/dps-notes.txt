To Do
=====

- Complete PEP 258 DPS Generic Implementation Details.

  - Fill in the blanks in API details.

  - Specify the nodes.py internal data structure implementation.

        [Tibs:] Eventually we need to have direct documentation in
        there on how it all hangs together - the DTD is not enough
        (indeed, is it still meant to be correct? [Yes, it is.]).

- Rework PEP 257, separating style from spec from tools, wrt DPS. See
  Doc-SIG from 2001-06-19/20.

- PEP 256:

  - Incorporate "modes" (one or two sets).
  - Draw the framework diagram properly as a graphic (once PEPs
    support graphics !-).

- PEP 258:

  - Mention 2.2-style "properties" with attribute docstrings.

- Document!

  - Modules.

  - DPS nodes (DTD element) semantics:

    - External (public) attributes (node.attributes).
    - Internal attributes (node.*).
    - Linking mechanism.

- Get cracking on the DPS itself!

- Add layout component to framework? Or part of the formatter?

- Add validation? See http://pytrex.sourceforge.net, RELAX NG.

- Incorporate readers/"input modes", using Tony Ibbs' 2001-08-03
  Doc-SIG post 'Suggestions for reST "modes"' as a base.

- Write modules for common transforms. See `Unimplemented Transforms`_
  below.

- Ask Python-dev for opinions (GvR for a pronouncement) on special
  variables (__author__, __version__, etc.): convenience vs. namespace
  pollution. Ask opinions on whether or not the DPS should recognize &
  use them.

- Once doctree.txt is fleshed out, how about breaking (most of) it up
  and putting it into nodes.py as docstrings?

- Refactor:

  - Apply the `coding conventions`_ as given below.

- Merge reStructuredText into DPS and rename it to "docutils".
  (SourceForge project registered & waiting.)

  - Merge test directories.
  - Remove complex import code.
  - Rename gpdi.dtd to docutils.dtd.
  - Rename writers/html.py to html4_css1.py. With aliases?

- Provide a mechanism to pass options to Readers, Writers, and Parsers
  through dps.core.publish/Publisher? Or create custom
  Reader/Writer/Parser objects first, and pass *them* to
  publish/Publisher?

- In reader.get_reader_class (& parser & writer too), should we be
  importing 'standalone' or 'dps.readers.standalone'? (This would
  avoid importing top-level modules if the module name is not in
  dps/readers. Potential nastiness.)

- Add "name" -> "id" attribute conversion.  We must have unique,
  SGML-ID-friendly id's and a one-to-one mapping for later lookup.

  - Implement a "name mangling" scheme: name "section title" becomes
    id "section_title", name "1" becomes id "footnote1" (or just
    "1"?).

  - Whenever possible, use the "name mangling" scheme.  When that's
    not possible (duplicate names, no name), and use an arbitrary
    sequential id.

  - ID as required.

  - Remove dependency on names as sole distinguishing characteristic.
    Use IDs instead.

    - Perhaps get rid of "name" attributes altoghether?

  - Perhaps keep a name->id mapping file?  This could be stored
    permanently, read by subsequent processing runs, and updated with
    new entries.  ("Persistent ID mapping"?)

  - When resolving reference IDs from names, we must check for
    non-existent mappings.  In the Writer or in a transform?

- Considerations for an HTML Writer [#]_:

  - Boolean attributes. ``<element boolean>`` is good, ``<element
    boolean="boolean">`` is bad.  Use a special value in attribute
    mappings, such as ``None``?

  - Escape double-dashes inside comments.

  - Put the language code into an appropriate element's LANG
    attribute (<HTML>?).

  - "Class" attributes should have no underscores (CSS requirement).

Coding Conventions
==================

This project shall follow the generic coding conventions as specified
in the `Style Guide for Python Code`__ and `Docstring Conventions`__
PEPs, with the following clarifications:

- 4 spaces per indentation level. No tabs.
- No one-liner compound statements (i.e., no ``if x: return``: use two
  lines & indentation), except for degenerate class or method
  definitions (i.e., ``class X: pass`` is O.K.).
- Lines should be no more than 78 or 79 characters long.
- "CamelCase" shall be used for class names.
- Use "lowercase" or "lowercase_with_underscores" for function,
  method, and variable names. For short names, maximum two joined
  words, use lowercase (e.g. 'tagname'). For long names with three or
  more joined words, or where it's hard to parse the split between two
  words, use lowercase_with_underscores (e.g., 'note_explicit_target',
  'explicit_target').

Unimplemented Transforms
========================

Footnote Gathering
------------------

Collect and move footnotes to the end of a document.


Hyperlink Target Gathering
--------------------------

It probably comes in two phases, because in a Python context we need
to *resolve* them on a per-docstring basis [do we? --DG], but if the
user is trying to do the callout form of presentation, they would then
want to group them all at the end of the document.


Reference Merging
-----------------

When merging two or more subdocuments (such as docstrings),
conflicting references may need to be resolved.  There may be:

- duplicate reference and/or substitution names that need to be made
  unique; and/or
- duplicate footnote numbers that need to be renumbered.

Should this be done before or after reference-resolving transforms
are applied? What about references from within one subdocument to
inside another?


Document Splitting
------------------

If the processed document is written to multiple files (possibly in a
directory tree), it will need to be split up. References will have to
be adjusted.

(HTML only? See Distributors_ below.)


Navigation
----------

If a document is split up, each segment will need navigation links:
parent, children (small TOC), previous (preorder), next (preorder).


Table of Contents
-----------------

This runs over the entire tree, and locates <section> elements. It
produces a <contents> subtree, which can be inserted at the
appropriate place, with links to the <section> elements. It needs to
make sure that the links it uses are *real*, so ideally it will use
the "implicit" link for a section when it exists, and it will have to
invent one when the implicit link isn't there (presumably because the
section is the twelfth "Introduction" in the document...).


Index
-----

@@@


I/O APIs
========

Can we use codecs for this?  Input to parser and output from formatter
are strings, but the intermediate data structure is a DOM tree.


Docstring Extractor
===================

We need code that scans a parsed Python module, and returns an ordered
tree containing the names, docstrings (including attribute and
additional docstrings), and additional info (in parentheses below) of
all of the following objects:

- packages
- modules
- module attributes (+ values)
- classes (+ inheritance)
- class attributes (+ values)
- instance attributes (+ values)
- methods (+ formal parameters & defaults)
- functions (+ formal parameters & defaults)

(Extract comments too? For example, comments at the start of a module
would be a good place for bibliographic field lists.)

In order to evaluate interpreted text cross-references, namespaces for
each of the above will also be required.

See python-dev/docstring-develop thread "AST mining", started on
2001-08-14.


Python Source Reader
====================

The Python Source Reader ("PySource") model that's evolving in my mind
goes something like this:

1. Extract the docstring/namespace [#]_ tree from the module(s) and/or
   package(s).

   .. [#] See `Docstring Extractor`_ above.

2. Run the parser on each docstring in turn, producing a forest of
   trees (internal data structure as per nodes.py).

3. Join the docstring trees together into a single tree, running
   transforms:

   - merge hyperlinks
   - merge namespaces
   - create various sections like "Module Attributes", "Functions",
     "Classes", "Class Attributes", etc.; see the DPS spec/ppdi.dtd
   - convert the above special sections to ordinary DPS nodes

4. Run transforms on the combined doctree.  Examples: resolving
   cross-references/hyperlinks (including interpreted text on Python
   identifiers); footnote auto-numbering; first field list ->
   bibliographic elements.

   (Or should step 4's transforms come before step 3?)

5. Pass the resulting unified tree to the writer/builder.

I've had trouble reconciling the roles of input parser and output
writer with the idea of modes ("readers" or "directors"). Does the
mode govern the tranformation of the input, the output, or both?
Perhaps the mode should be split into two.

For example, say the source of our input is a Python module. Our
"input mode" should be the "Python Source Reader". It discovers (from
``__docformat__``) that the input parser is "reStructuredText". If we
want HTML, we'll specify the "HTML" output formatter. But there's a
piece missing. What *kind* or *style* of HTML output do we want?
PyDoc-style, LibRefMan style, etc. (many people will want to specify
and control their own style). Is the output style specific to a
particular output format (XML, HTML, etc.)? Is the style specific to
the input mode? Or can/should they be independent?

I envision interaction between the input parser, an "input mode" , and
the output formatter. The same intermediate data format would be used
between each of these, being transformed as it progresses.


Docutils Project Model
======================

Here's the latest project model::

                    +--------------------------+
                    |        Docutils:         |
                    | docutils.core.Publisher, |
                    | docutils.core.publish()  |
                    +--------------------------+
                      /                      \
                     /                        \
           1,3,5    /                          \      6,8
           +--------+                          +--------+
           | READER | =======================> | WRITER |
           +--------+ (purely presentational)  +--------+
            //    \                              /    \
           //      \                            /      \
    2     //     4  \               7          /     9  \
    +--------+   +------------+     +------------+   +--------------+
    | PARSER |...| reader     |     | writer     |...| DISTRIBUTOR  |
    +--------+   | transforms |     | transforms |   |              |
                 |            |     |            |   | - one file   |
                 | - docinfo  |     | - styling  |   | - many files |
                 | - titles   |     | - writer-  |   | - objects in |
                 | - linking  |     |   specific |   |   memory     |
                 | - lookups  |     | - etc.     |   +--------------+
                 | - reader-  |     +------------+
                 |   specific |
                 | - parser-  |
                 |   specific |
                 | - layout   |
                 | - etc.     |
                 +------------+

The numbers indicate the path a document would take through the code.
Double-width lines between reader & parser and between reader &
writer, indicating that data sent along these paths should be standard
(pure & unextended) DPS doc trees. Single-width lines signify that
internal tree extensions are OK (but must be supported internally at
both ends), and may in fact be totally unrelated to the DPS doc tree
structure. I've added "reader-specific" and "layout" transforms to the
list of transforms. BTW, these transforms are not necessarily all in
one directory; it's a nebulous grouping (it's hard to draw ASCII
clouds).


Issues
------

- Transforms.  How to specify which transforms (and in what order)
  apply to each combination of reader, parser/syntax, writer, and
  distributor?  Even if we restrict ourselves to one parser, there
  will eventually be a multitude of readers, writers, and distributor
  options.

  Or are readers & writers independent?  Then we have reader/parser
  and writer/distributor combinations to consider.


Components
----------

Production -> Publication -> Distribution

Producer -> Publisher -> Distributor


Parsers
```````

Responsibilities: Given raw input text and an empty doctree, populate
the doctree by parsing the input text.


Readers
```````

Most Readers will have to be told what parser to use. So far (see the
list of examples below), only the Python Source Reader (PySource) will
be able to determine the syntax on its own.

Responsibilities:

- Do raw input on the source.
- Pass the raw text to the parser, along with a fresh doctree.
- Combine and collate doctrees if necessary.
- Run transforms over the doctree(s).

Examples:

- Standalone/Raw/Plain: Just read a text file and process it. The
  reader needs to be told which parser to use. Parser-specific
  readers?
- Python Source: See `Python Source Reader`_ above.
- Email: RFC-822 headers, quoted excerpts, signatures, MIME parts.
- PEP: RFC-822 headers, "PEP xxxx" and "RFC xxxx" conversion to
  URIs. Either interpret PEPs' indented sections or convert existing
  PEPs to reStructuredText (or both?).
- Wiki: Global reference lookups of "wiki links" incorporated into
  transforms. (CamelCase only or unrestricted?) Lazy indentation?
- Web Page: As standalone, but recognize meta fields as meta tags.
  Support for templates of some sort? (After <body>, before </body>?)
- FAQ: Structured "question & answer(s)" constructs.
- Compound document: Merge chapters into a book. Master TOC file?


Transforms
``````````

Responsibilities:

- Modify a doctree in-place.

Examples:

- Already implemented: DocInfo, DocTitle (in frontmatter.py);
  Hyperlinks, Footnotes, Substitutions (in references.py).
- Unimplemented: See `Unimplemented Transforms`_ above.


Writers
```````

Responsibilities:

- Transform doctree into specific output formats.
- Transform references into format-native forms.

Examples:

- XML: Various forms, such as DocBook. Also, raw doctree XML.
- HTML
- TeX
- Plain text
- reStructuredText?


Distributors
````````````

(Writer/distributor components may change places. After rearranging,
the model would look like this::


           1,3,5                               6,8
           +--------+                          +-------------+
           | READER | =======================> | DISTRIBUTOR |
           +--------+ (purely presentational)  +-------------+
            //    \                              /    \
           //      \                            /      \
    2     //     4  \               7          /     9  \
    +--------+   +------------+     +------------+   +--------+
    | PARSER |...| reader     |     | writer     |...| WRITER |
    +--------+   | transforms |     | transforms |   +--------+
                 | ...        |     | ...        |

We'll wait and see which arrangement works out best.  Is it better for
the writer to control the distributor, or vice versa?  Or should they
be equals?

Looking at the list of writers, it seems that only HTML would require
anything other than monolithic output.  Perhaps merge the HTML
"distributor" into "writer" variants?)

Responsibilities:

- Do raw output to the destination.
- Transform references per incarnation (type of distribution).

Examples:

- Single file
- Multiple files & directories
- Objects in memory
