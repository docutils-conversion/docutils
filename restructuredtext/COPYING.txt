Most of the files included in this project are in the public domain,
and therefore have no license requirement and no restrictions on
copying or usage.  The only exception is:

- test/difflib.py, copyright by the Python Software Foundation,
  licensed under the `Python 2.2 license`_.  This file is included for
  compatibility with Python versions less than 2.2; if you have Python
  2.2 or higher, difflib.py is not needed and may be removed.  (It's
  only used to report test failures anyhow; it isn't installed
  anywhere.  The included file is a pre-generator version of the
  difflib.py module included in Python 2.2.)

(Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer.)  The Python license is OSI-approved_
and GPL-compatible_.  Although complicated by multiple owners and lots
of legalese, it basically lets you copy, use, modify, and redistribute
files as long as you keep the copyright attribution intact, note any
changes you make, and don't use the owner's name in vain.
