Structural Elements
===================

Section Title
-------------

That's it, the text just above this line.

Transitions
-----------

Here's a transition:

---------

It divides the section.

Body Elements
=============

Paragraphs
----------

A paragraph.

Inline Markup
`````````````

Paragraphs contain text and may contain inline markup: *emphasis*,
**strong emphasis**, `interpreted text`, ``inline literals``,
standalone hyperlinks (http://www.python.org), external hyperlinks
(Python_), internal cross-references (example_), footnote references
([1]_), substitution references (|example|), and _`inline hyperlink
targets`. Problems are indicated by |problematic| text.

Bullet Lists
------------

- A bullet list

  + Nested bullet list.
  + Nested item 2.

- Item 2.

Enumerated Lists
----------------

1. Arabic numerals.

   a) lower alpha

      (i) lower roman

          A. upper alpha

             I) upper roman

Definition Lists
----------------

Term
    Definition
Term : classifier
    Definition paragraph 1.

    Definition paragraph 2.

Field Lists
-----------

:what: Field lists map field names to field bodies, like database
       records.

:how arg1 arg2:

    The field marker is a colon, the field name, optional field
    arguments, and a colon.

    The field body may contain one or more body elements, indented
    relative to the field marker.

Option Lists
------------

For listing command-line options:

-a            command-line option "a"
-b file       options can have arguments
              and long descriptions
--long        options can be long also
--input=file  long options can also have
              arguments
--very-long-option
              The description can also start on the next line.

              The description may contain multiple body elements.
/V            DOS/VMS-style options too

There must be at least two spaces between the option and the
description.

Literal Blocks
--------------

Literal blocks are indented, and indicated with a double-colon
("::") at the end of the preceding paragraph (right here -->)::

    if literal_block:
        text = 'is left as-is'
        spaces_and_linebreaks = 'are preserved'
        markup_processing = None

Block Quotes
------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    This theory, that is mine, is mine.

Doctest Blocks
--------------

>>> print 'Python-specific usage examples; begun with ">>>"'
Python-specific usage examples; begun with ">>>"
>>> print '(cut and pasted from interactive Python sessions)'
(cut and pasted from interactive Python sessions)

Tables

+------------------------+------------+----------+----------+
| Header row, column 1   | Header 2   | Header 3 | Header 4 |
| (header rows optional) |            |          |          |

| body row 3             | Cells may  | - Table cells       |
+------------------------+ span rows. | - contain           |
| body row 4             |            | - body elements.    |
+------------------------+------------+---------------------+

Footnotes
---------

.. [label] A footnote contains body elements, consistently
   indented by at least 3 spaces.

.. [#] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually or automatically
   using a "#" label. Manual and automatic footnotes may not be mixed.

Targets
-------

.. _example:

This paragraph is pointed to by the "example" target.

Section headers are implicit targets, referred to by name. See
Targets_, which is a subsection of `Body Elements`_.

Explicit external targets are interpolated into references such as
"Python_".

Directives
----------

Images
``````

An image directive:

.. image:: ../docs/images/title.png

A figure directive:

.. figure:: ../docs/images/title.png
   [alt="reStructuredText, the markup syntax"]

   A figure is an image with a caption and/or a legend:

   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | re         | Revised, revisited, based on 're' module.     |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+

Error Handling
==============

Any errors caught during processing will generate system messages.
There should be one in the following, system-generated section,
"Docutils System Messages":
