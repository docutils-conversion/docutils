Section Title

That's it, the text just above this line.

Transitions
-----------

Here's a transition:

---------

It divides the section.

Body Elements
=============

Paragraphs
----------

A paragraph.

Inline Markup
`````````````

Paragraphs contain text and may contain inline markup: *emphasis*,
**strong emphasis**, `interpreted text`, ``inline literals``,
standalone hyperlinks (http://www.python.org), external hyperlinks
(Python_), internal cross-references (example_), footnote references
(manually numbered [1]_, anonymous auto-numbered [#]_, labeled
auto-numbered [#label]_, or symbolic [*]_), citation references
([CIT2002]_), substitution references (|example|), and _`inline
hyperlink targets` (see Targets_ below for a reference back to here).
Problems are indicated by |problematic| text (generated by processing
errors; this one is intentional).

Bullet Lists
------------

- A bullet list

  + Nested bullet list.
  + Nested item 2.

- Item 2.

Enumerated Lists
----------------

1. Arabic numerals.

   a) lower alpha)

      (i) (lower roman)

          A. upper alpha.

             I) upper roman)

2. Lists that don't start at 1:

   3. Three

   4. Four

   C. C

   D. D

   iii. iii

   iv. iv

Definition Lists
----------------

Term

Term : classifier
    Definition paragraph 1.

    Definition paragraph 2.

Field Lists
-----------

:what: Field lists map field names to field bodies, like database
       records. They are often part of an extension syntax.

:how arg1 arg2:

    The field marker is a colon, the field name, optional field
    arguments, and a colon.

    The field body may contain one or more body elements, indented
    relative to the field marker.

Option Lists
------------

For listing command-line options:

-a            command-line option "a"
-b file       options can have arguments
              and long descriptions
--long        options can be long also
--input=file  long options can also have
              arguments

--very-long-option
              The description can also start on the next line.

              The description may contain multiple body elements,
              regardless of where it starts.

-x, -y, -z    Multiple options are an "option group".
-v, --verbose  Commonly-seen: short & long options.
-1 file, --one=file, --two file
              Multiple options with arguments.
/V            DOS/VMS-style options too

There must be at least two spaces between the option and the
description.

Literal Blocks
--------------

Literal blocks are indented, and indicated with a double-colon ("::")
at the end of the preceding paragraph (right here ``-->``)::

    if literal_block:
        text = 'is left as-is'
        spaces_and_linebreaks = 'are preserved'
        markup_processing = None

Block Quotes
------------

Block quotes consist of indented body elements:

    This theory, that is mine, is mine.

    -- Anne Elk (Miss)

Doctest Blocks
--------------

>>> print 'Python-specific usage examples; begun with ">>>"'
Python-specific usage examples; begun with ">>>"
>>> print '(cut and pasted from interactive Python sessions)'
(cut and pasted from interactive Python sessions)

+------------------------+-----------------------+----------+

Footnotes
---------

.. [1] A footnote contains body elements, consistently indented by at
   least 3 spaces.

   This is the footnote's second paragraph.

.. [#label] Footnotes may be numbered, either manually (as in [1]_) or
   automatically using a "#"-prefixed label.  This footnote has a
   label so it can be referred to from multiple places, both as a
   footnore reference ([#label]_) and as a hyperlink reference
   (label_).

.. [#] This footnote is numbered automatically and anonymously using a
   label of "#" only.

.. [*] Footnotes may also use symbols, specified with a "*" label.
   Here's a reference to the next footnote: [*]_.

.. [*] This footnote shows the next symbol in the sequence.

.. [4] Here's an unreferenced footnote, with a reference to a
   nonexistent footnote: [5]_.

Citations
---------

.. [CIT2002] Citations are text-labeled footnotes. They may be
   rendered separately and differently from footnotes.

Here's a reference to the above, [CIT2002]_, and a [nonexistent]_
citation.

Targets
-------

.. _example:

This paragraph is pointed to by the explicit "example" target. A
reference can be found under `Inline Markup`_, above. `Inline
hyperlink targets`_ are also possible.

Section headers are implicit targets, referred to by name. See
Targets_, which is a subsection of `Body Elements`_.

Explicit external targets are interpolated into references such as
"Python_".

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/

Targets may be indirect and anonymous.  Thus `this phrase`__ may also
refer to the Targets_ section.

__ Targets_

Here's a `hyperlink reference without a target`_.

Directives
----------

.. contents:: :local:

Document Components
```````````````````

An example of the "contents" directive can be seen above this section
(local, untitled table of contents) and at the beginning of the
document (document-wide `table of contents`_).

Images
``````

An image directive:

.. image:: ../docs/images/title.png

A figure directive:

.. figure:: ../docs/images/title.png
   :alt: reStructuredText, the markup syntax

   A figure is an image with a caption and/or a legend:

   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | re         | Revised, revisited, based on 're' module.     |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Structured | Structure-enhanced text, structuredtext.      |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Text       | Well it is, isn't it?                         |
   +------------+-----------------------------------------------+

   This paragraph is also part of the legend.
