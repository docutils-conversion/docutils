Rrefactor-test
==============

The ``Rrefactor-test`` branch is being used by Garth to try out a major 
re-structuring of the reStructuredText unit tests. Working on such an 
update in ``MAIN`` or ``rel-0-3`` would be downright impolite, hence the 
branch. 

Changes made in ``Rrefactor-test`` will be merged into ``MAIN`` when, and 
if, the following occur: 

* Garth starts his work. 
* Garth finishes his work. 
* David is persuaded that Garth's changes are useful. 

Release 0.3 (2001-07-19)
========================

Removed all explicit hyperlink targets matching section titles in spec
documents; they are now declared implicitly (see
spec/reStructuredText.txt).

* restructuredtext/states.py: Added to project.

* restructuredtext/test_states.py: Added to project.

* restructuredtext/ndiff.py: Added to project. This is a modified
  version of Python's Tools/scripts/ndiff.py, and is used by 
  test_states.py. I have committed to adding its functionality to
  Python's Lib/difflib.py.

* spec/reStructuredText.txt:

  - Introduced implicit hyperlink targets for section titles.
  - Changed 'comment block' to 'explicit markup block'. Rearranged &
    edited the text of footnotes, hyperlink targets, directives, &
    comments.
  - Clarified the syntax of interpreted text roles.
  - Clarified the case-insensitivity and character set of hyperlink
    names, footnote labels, and directives.
  - Changed the definition for simple link names and footnote labels
    (underlines and dashes allowed internally only, not at begin/end).
  - Added 'Error Handling' section.


Release 0.2 (2001-06-18)
========================

* spec/introduction.txt: Minor changes.

* spec/reStructuredText.txt:

  - Added workable indented section syntax, then removed it. See
    spec/indentedsections.txt (included in this release only).
  - Added details of whitespace preservation in inline literals.

* spec/problems.txt:

  - Revised analysis of indented sections.

* HISTORY.txt: Added to project.


Release 0.1 (2001-06-02)
========================

The project web site and the first project release were rolled out.
Posted all but dps-notes.txt to the Doc-SIG 2001-06-03.

* spec/introduction.txt:

  - Title changed from "A Plan for Structured Text".
  - Expanded and revised the "Goals" section.
  - Brought the "History" section up to date.
  - Added the "Parser Implementation Plan" section.
  - Added internal cross-references (in anticipation of the far-off
    day when we can actually *process* these files :-).

* spec/reStructuredText.txt:

  - Title changed from "reStructuredText: Revised Structured Text
    Specification".
  - Added "Quick Syntax Overview".
  - Moved syntax diagrams from their own section to be adjacent to
    their construct.
  - Tightened up syntax specifications.
  - Changed "descriptive lists" to "definition lists", changed syntax.
  - Added field lists. Syntax not settled yet.
  - Added header row separator ('=') to tables.
  - Allowed comment blocks (comments, directives, hyperlink targets,
    footnotes) to occur in nested blocks.
  - Changed phrase-link delimiters from square brackets to backquotes.
  - Added a set of inline markup delimiter recognition rules.
  - Added interpreted text using backquotes ('`').
  - Changed inline literals to use double-backquotes ('``').
  - Added internal cross-references (to the doc, not the spec).
  - General reorganization, editing, & cleanup.

* spec/pyextensions.txt: Added to project (option lists, doctest
  blocks, and interpreted text interpretations).

* spec/problems.txt:

  - Added sections: "Blank Lines in Lists", "Definition List Markup",
    "Underlining".
  - General editing & cleanup. Tightened up analyses, added
    alternatives.

* spec/rst-notes.txt: Added to project.
