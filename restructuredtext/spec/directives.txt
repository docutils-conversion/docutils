This document describes the directives implemented in the reference
reStructuredText parser.


-------------
 Admonitions
-------------

DTD elements: attention, caution, danger, error, important, note, tip,
warning.

Admonitions are specially marked 'topics' that can appear anywhere an
ordinary body element can.  They contain arbitrary body elements.
Typically, an admonition is rendered as an offset block in a document,
sometimes outlined or shaded, with a title matching the admonition
type.  For example::

    .. DANGER::
       Beware killer rabbits!

This directive might be rendered something like this::

    +------------------------+
    |        !DANGER!        |
    |                        |
    | Beware killer rabbits! |
    +------------------------+

The following admonition directives have been implemented:

- attention
- caution
- danger
- error
- important
- note
- tip
- warning

Any text immediately following the directive indicator (on the same
line and/or indented on following lines) is interpreted as a directive
block and is parsed for normal body elements.  For example, the
following 'note' admonition directive contains one paragraph and a
bullet list consisting of two list items::

    .. note:: This is a note admonition.
       This is the second line of the first paragraph.

       - The note contains all indented body elements
         following.
       - It includes this bullet list.

 Image Directives
------------------

There are two image directives: 'image' and 'figure'.


Image
=====

DTD element: image.

An 'image' is a simple picture::

    .. image:: picture.png

The URI for the image source file is specified in the directive data.
As with hyperlink targets, the image URI may begin on the same line as
the explicit markup start and target name, or it may begin in an
indented text block immediately following, with no intervening blank
lines.  If there are multiple lines in the link block, they are
stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and joined together.

Optionally, the last line of the link block may contain an image
attribute specification, in square brackets, as follows::

    .. image:: picture.png
               [height=100 width=200 scale=50]

The attribute specification must be the only text on that line.  None,
some, or all of the 'height', 'width', and 'scale' attributes may be
present.  The values are all integers; 'height' and 'width' values are
in pixels, and 'scale' is a percentage.


Figure
======

DTD elements: figure, image, caption, legend.

A 'figure' consists of an image, an optional caption (a single
paragraph), and an optional legend (arbitrary body elements)::

    .. figure:: picture.png

       This is the caption of the figure (a simple paragraph).

       +-----------------------+-----------------------+
       | Symbol                | Meaning               |
       +=======================+=======================+
       | .. image:: tent.png   | Campground            |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------+
       | .. image:: waves.png  | Lake                  |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------+
       | .. image:: peak.png   | Mountain              |
       +-----------------------+-----------------------+

There must be a blank line before the caption paragraph.  To specify a
legend without a caption, use an empty comment ('..') in place of the
caption.

 Miscellaneous Directives

Test Directive
==============

DTD element: directive.

'Restructuredtext-test-directive' is provided for test purposes
(nobody is expected to type in a name *that* long!).
